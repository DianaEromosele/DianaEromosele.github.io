        <p>Hey, I'm Diana Ozemebhoya Eromosele, an aspiring software engineer. I'm learning how to code at Dev Bootcamp in New York City, her hometown. 
        <p>
        I'm also a multimedia journalist. You can read and watch my highest-trafficking pieces at my blog, <a href="www.lecturestobeats.com" /> Lectures to Beats</a>. 
<p>
I'm a Staff Writer for The Root, hosts and produces segments for The Root TV, and develops engaging content for companies and brands looking to communicate with top influencers. Diana has also
written for CNN.com, The Grio and msnbc.com. She appeared on msnbc.com as a commentator, WPIX’s Channel 11 News as a news expert and regularly
contributes commentary to The Nick Taliaferro show on Philly’s 900AM WURD station.

I received my B.A. in Political Science from Duke University, and a M.P.S. in Journalism from Georgetown University.
