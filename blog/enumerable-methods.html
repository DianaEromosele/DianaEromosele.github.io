        <h1>Let's Map Out this Enumerable#Map Method!</h1>
        <h2>It works like the word (and the method) "each", in that it does something to each of the elements in a holding object. </h2>

        <p>The "Map" enumerable method is a wonderful iterative method that allows you to execute a block of code for each object in an enumerator. 
         <p>
        An enumerator is an object, such as an array, hash or string that is capable of being iterated through. 
         <p>
        The "map" method is similar to the "each" method, in that, again, it allows you to address every piece of element in a container.
         <p>
        Take the example below that I pulled from Ruby Docs: 
         <p>
        We start with an array filled with four words.. Let's say we want to add love to each of those words. We use the "Map" method, followed by a block of code, to signal that we want to do that.
        <p>
        ````
        <p>
        ["I", "You", "God", "We"].map { |word| word + "love" }     
        <p>
         #=> ["I love", "You love", "God love", "We love"]
        ````
        <p>
        It's important to remember that the result is an array, filled with elements that are now altered to include the block of code executed. It 
        <p>
        Keep in mind that it will always return an array, even if your initial enumerator is not an array. let's start with a hash, as follows:
        <p>
        ````
        family = {}
family["diana"] = "dirrtydee"
family["Esi"] = "babygirl"
family["Liz"] = "Wizzie"

````
<p>
Then we'll iterate through the hash, so that the vaulue is all upperase. 
<p>
````
family.map { |key, value| 
    p value.upcase
}
    => ["DIRRTYDEE", "BABYGIRL", "WIZZIE"]

    ````
    <p>
    Notice how we started with a hash, but the results, the keys in uppercase, is in an array. That's the in's and out's of the "map" method.
