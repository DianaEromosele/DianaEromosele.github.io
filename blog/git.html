      <p>What are the benefits of version control?
      
      as a software developer, you're going to want to be able to contribute to code, without the fear or apprehension that you're messing up a super complex coding project. super important software. version control allows programmers to work on their own individual slice of code--to play with it, makee modifications to it, test things out, without altering an existing master copy. 
      
      when you're confident that you've got your code in tip-top shape, then you can offer it up for review by a lead engineer, who can then decide if it will be incorporated into the master code. 
      
      version control allows for multiple developers on the same team, or individual programmers from around the world to build upon a project in this way.

          How does git help you keep track of changes?
          
          git allows you to package code, and ship them to remote places (github, for instance) to store the code.
          
          then it allows you to download code from those remote places, so that if anything happens to your hardware (your laptop, etc.), the code is stored in a remote place. 
          
          every time you make a significant change to a block of code, that you feel is worthy of noting, you can use the git coding system to put up a red flag, of sorts, at that spot. if you want to back-track, or back-pedal, back to that place in the code, back to that point, it will be easier, because you can go back to that red flag (known as a commit in git). it allows you to leave bookmarks of sort in your code, to keep track of changes.

          Why use GitHub to store your code?
          
          a few reasons:
        
        1. again, if anything happens to your hardware (your laptop, etc.), the code is stored in a remote place. github is a remote online hub that stores your code, and allows programmers to access that code whereever they have internet connectivity and a laptop. 
        
        2. github is great for open-source projects. developers around the world, or on the same team, can access code on github, and contribute to it. github has a great version-control system, that enables a lead engineer to decide which code that has been offered up by programmers, will be incorporated into the main project.
