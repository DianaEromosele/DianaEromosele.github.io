        <!--Create an example class and use it to teach others when to use instance variables, instance methods, etc. for that object. Write for an audience of newb programmers.-->
        <p>
        Let's create a "Diana" Class. <p>This class will hold instance variables, about myself, like my name, age and my career. I'll then create a couple of methods that will allow me to use those instance variables. The reason why I created instance variables is that I can use the in a variety of methods inside this class. Take a look below. 
        <p>
            
        class Diana
            <p>def initialize(name, age, career)
                <p>@name = name
               <p> @age = 29
               <p> @career = software engineer 
            <p>end
            
            <p>def how_she_greets
               <p> puts "Hey my name is #{@name}. i'm #{@age}. nice to meet you."
            <p>end
            
           <p> def how_she_networks
                <p>puts "i'm a #{career} in training. My background is in media; I used to be a journalist."
            <p>end
            
            
        end
