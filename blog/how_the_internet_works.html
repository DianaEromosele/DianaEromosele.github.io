        Here are a few things about this phenomenon we call "the Internet" that I culled from this cool <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc>YouTube</a> video.
      <p> 
   
   
   <text id="number">1.</text> The Internet is a wire buried in the group. What's it made of? Fiber optics, optics and it can beamed to satellties or through cellphone networks.<p>
   <text id="number">2.</text> Two computers connected to the Internet can communicate. That's why we can e-mail, text-message and FaceTime.<p>
   <text id="number">3.</text> In fact, <text id="popwords">a Server</text> is a computer that is connected directly to the Internet. So most of the personal laptops and computers that we ordinary people use are not servers. They're called <text id="popwords">Clients.</text><p>
   <text id="number">4.</text>Webpages are files on a server's harddrive.<p>
   <text id="number">5.</text> Every server has a unique IP address. The user-friendly version of an IP address is <text id="popwords">the domain address</text>, like Google.com, or Facebook.com, or YourPersonalBlog.com. <p>
   <text id="number">6.</text> Here's the connection flow of your client laptop: </article>
   
   <text class="connection_flow">
   <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
   Personal Laptop (the Client) -- Internet Service Provider (Optimum, DSL) - Internet (The wire in the ground)  </pre></text>
   
  <article>
   <text id="number">7.</text> You can then look at webpages and communicate with machines that are connected to the Internet directly (servers) and indirectly (other clients like yourself). <p>
   
   <text id="number">8.</text> **Everything** connected directly or indirectly to the Internet has an IP address. Not just servers. Clients, cell phones, smartphones, routers, etc. <p>
   <text id="number">9.</text> That's how machines communicate and are able to send data to each other, using the IP addresses of every machine connected to the Internet.<p>
   <text id="number">10.</text> <text id="popwords">A Router</text> is a piece of equipment that lay at the virtual intersection of where two or more parts of the Internet connect. Routers help transport data around the Internet.

<!--It went really well. You get a sense of how many webpage skeletons are similar. The CSS and Javascript bring them to life, and give them interactivity. -->

<!--I found wireframing to be very helpful, because I was able to look at the document as a reference of where my elements will be.-->

<!--We wanted to be sure that you communicated where our photo, article, headline, and sidebar widgets would be. -->

<!--I had always bumped into the "div" tags, but learning about what it actually does was new to me. In addition to the best practices of not formatting or styling HTML, and leaving that up to CSS.-->
