It went really well. You get a sense of how many webpage skeletons are similar. The CSS and Javascript bring them to life, and give them interactivity. 

I found wireframing to be very helpful, because I was able to look at the document as a reference of where my elements will be.

We wanted to be sure that you communicated where our photo, article, headline, and sidebar widgets would be. 

I had always bumped into the "div" tags, but learning about what it actually does was new to me. In addition to the best practices of not formatting or styling HTML, and leaving that up to CSS.
