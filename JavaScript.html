        <h1>Looping in Ruby vs. Looping in JavaScript </h1>
        <h2>One spells it out for you; while the other compacts everything.</h2>

        <p>
            
            
        Ruby is easy to read. Let's say you want to repeat something, or run a program based on given input or algorithm. Ruby allows users to declare what the starting point will be, and allows users to increment or decrement from that starting point, by using some sort of loop statement. Here I'm using a while statement.
        
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
        this_thing = 0
        
        while this_thing <= 20
               p this_thing
            this_thing += 4
        end 
        </pre>
        
        <p>That same code written in Javascript, would look like this:</p>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
        for (var this_thing=0; this_thing <=20; this_thing +=4);
            console.log(this_thing)
            }
        
        </pre>
        
        <p>You can probably sense the similarities, but the Javascript loop puts all of its elements on one line, making it not  as intuitive or reader friendly. Ruby reads more linearly, whereas Javascript is a bit more compact, although, one could argue that it's more programmer-friendlys since coders know that three elements are supposed to go inside that parentheses. You're less likely to forgive a key part of the loop.
