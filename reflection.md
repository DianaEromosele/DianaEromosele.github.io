What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I used the margins to give my elements more cushioning, so to speak, more space from things so that it stands out on its own. Borders also make the elements pop, since it distinguishes the element from the background color of the webpage. 


What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I used the "width" property to extend my main photo, the display property and the "static" value to position other elements.
Positioning is a crucial part of the layout. 

I couldn't get the stylesheet to load properly for my blog index site, but I plan to speak with an instructor during office hours for that. The index for my main site looks fine.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The main photo was the easiest to implement. I was able to edit the photo beforehand, upload it, then tweak the height of and it's width using CSS to make it center and wide.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

There are a lot of moving parts that go into it, but the key is to keep it simple and clean. Also, organization is key. The more efficient your code, the better.
